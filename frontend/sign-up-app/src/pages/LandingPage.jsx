Symptoms consistent with gender dysphoria. They have to be identified in the first 30 days and then the service secretaries for the next 30 days to begin their process for separation from the United States military. No additional matter.

Neighbors reported hearings. Hey, let's go. Tell me, what is your perspective on the changes that have taken place from them to now? Shenzhen City stands at a significant milestone in history. This didn't come along by chance, you must understand. This was made possible only through the absolute hard work, perseverance and courage of its wonderful citizens. Over the past century, this all started to become possible when you, Mayor Sinhagara, took office at Shinja City's mayor. In my humble opinion, many would agree with me. That's really overstating it.

Residents displaced due to redevelopment have been quietly swept under the rug. Can you keep your questions free please, Sir. Apologies. Shinzo City's transformation to a better place was Highland. I'm wondering about the increasing number of strange incidents and unresolved cases. I'd like to know Mayor Sunahan, what are your thoughts on it? You're bringing up things like the increase in missing persons and the opposing leader. But where's your evidence? When have you ever heard the police make those statements? Well, the investigations. Factual evidence matters here. Facts only. If your intention is to unfairly harm this city's reputation, I implore you, stop making false testimonies. I've got it all right here. I'm sure you're quite aware, Mister Kamiyama, but the consequences of false rumors, aren't you. Do we have another question? Hey, Cortana. This closest church for a bit, and it's only a decade.

I said to him this morning. How do you prefer? Call. Hey, Cortana. Hey, Cortana. Did I? Did I text it? Did I confirm you mean? Audio investor, my audience. Together. I sent them. I sent them on the on the thread that we had the other day when I asked when you get on the phone. OK. It's good as you. It doesn't. I can't tell if they send it. Yeah. Just wondering. Right now. That you heard me. It's very important. To you and me. Hey, Cortana. Hey Cortana, have all these people down in London. I don't know why. Yeah. No, really, I like Randy, but he keeps on the morning two meetings, it's like. You know, it's like it's very self centered after while, you know. I don't think you understand that. You should, huh? If you want to go back, yeah, no, I know, I know. But I'm just thinking of the way you recruit any matter I'm recruiting, but you know. He's like making sure he gets his people addressed. So you're gonna do it like that? Create a separate one, you know, read those lungs you want. Remind me better. Am I being better here? I'm never going to call it as much as he's not available. I'm not. You know what? I'm not ready for him to be available. I'm not looking for a doctor, Ronnie, to be able to talk to, to talk about. You know I got you. I mean, I do three ways with you. I might have done 13 way to bring it. 5000 OK thanks. Now because we were the 3rd. Do you think because we were there on the first day that he's actually going to put us from? You're at the top of my leg, I know, but you should be a 3 winner at the top of this day. Yes, he already is. If you're ready. Ready. Randy like to, you know, I wasn't the first to talk. He has his little guys and he took well, you know what? Do you know that he had never said Utah are you know what I'm talking about 7 different matrices. Yeah. Yeah, you. Can't feel like that. You know. They didn't. Should have started out with one, you know what I'm saying? Anyway, yeah, so we'll see. We'll see. Well, you know what? We'll talk before that to find out, you know? We should be pretty high up in the heart because we were there day one and he said turn your application. We did. So. Hey Cortana, bring at least 45 people a week. Yeah, me too. Me too. I got this insurance guy. You know, I'm never going on Facebook, but I got on Facebook calls this guy Shane and talk to him. And I hear you work together at Best Buy. I actually got insurance and I said, hey, I've seen this thing. You might want to look at it so you don't call it wrong. OK bum, bum bum or zoom on zoom, that's what you said, I respond. Ed. Thank you. Should I say no problem. Thank you much. Yeah, thanks. Thanks. Hey, Cortana. Oh alrighty. What do we need? Some more phone calls? I gotta get some people, more people on it. More of the Mariner, you know. Yeah, well, you know, this is long go deeper. Why? Why, why? Just do. What's this for the 10% check matter. You don't have to have a structure. Alrighty, alrighty, I'll hire you later. OK. Put no answer Randy about Dr Ronnie too. Thanks. Alright, bye. Hey, Cortana. Hey. Hey, Cortana. Very small. Hey Cortana, framework here around the budget proposal and. Yeah, Medicaid and Social Security and then most. For the budget resolution, but there is the time frame of having to keep the lights on. Yes, so. So he wants to get this package done as quickly as possible and I think that's when you start to see perhaps some great accounting tricks like you see perhaps the Senate news, so. You know this the reason that the Senate abides by these rules. Is because they don't. Keir Starmer, the Prime Minister of the UK. And we're gonna watch this beginning right now. Thank you. Thank you. Discussions about that. Through the Prime Minister is very second state. Ment. Tremendously productive. Most importantly, have provided the Prime Minister with an update on her. Efforts to empty bloody and horrible in Ukraine, Russia which would never have happened to the. This. Difficult to get, but it's really very good. This includes vast amounts of military library and having to various other things that way down after starting rebuilding, that was. Will provide the basis for our sustainable future. And they stimulate the prosperity that. I understand what was happening. Our judge is basically common sense. Common sense would be a one piece. You have to. Thousands of young people in this case. That what I'm talking about. Americans, we're talking about Ukrainians and Russians are being killed every week. Thousands. What they are with thousands of people. Anywhere. Again, it's a horrible thing that's going well, such as Aristotle. Ukraine shows exactly why it's so important for the United. Capabilities in many cases. 4% or 5% of GDP. The Prime Minister once again for. Traveling here today. Many years. Hey, Cortana. Great trade agreement. Vice President. Something. With the Prime Minister, I just want to thank you again and please thank Jones for the inviting that look forward to your. Thank you very much. We start side by side still. And we focus now on bringing money. All the disk encouragement to regime was live during. States they couldn't be higher and we're determined to work together to deliver. If you don't win. Just in our lives and improve. So we move enough hurry to get things done, but that's what the UK in the US. OK. Let's see here. As most people do that they're paid by consumers and employers when they can put things into this country, can you explain how you came to this belief that foreign governments are paying tariffs? For the Prime Minister, did you discuss with President Trump his repeated statements of desired energy and execution? But but. We've been trained very. Far. Especially. I put massive tarps on Canada during my four years with the best economy in the history of our country. Maybe the best economy is to be I had. I used to have things. To eat things up. In particular question which have been hundreds of millions of dollars and we have no inflation put out there really don't like. Terrorists and I find we just have to look at the numbers. But my father. Says not existed and I don't think it's going to exist. So many things back to our country. I think you're trying to find a divide. Thank you. Please. Go ahead. Go ahead please. Expect to do that. Thank you. Jeff Thank you, Sir Pardon me, Mister, President, do you support publicly? And are you concerned that it might be triggered if you're in this report? Just stop getting. That. Millions of viewers watched. Is the Prime Minister or anybody else? Never happened to be a piece of question for the Prime Minister. Thank you, Mr Prime Minister, you were asking for President today. About that stop for Europe is the peacekeeping force and it's up in Ukraine. Did you feel like you got dissatisfied? Answer for yourself, Mr President, if you want to comment on that as well, please do. The personal says that they are left to come first, but yes, my team was going to be talking about. How we make sure that? OK please. How much did the US expect to receive and when you expect to receive that? Substantial amount of work, probably. President Trump succeeds with his. Super cuts your salary to get these figures. Who are the minds of breach? Es. This is. So. Physically and mentally, they've come out of it. Many young people, young people. Situation, but I think they make it much better and I think that's just the 4 weeks. I think we've had a huge impact on Gaza in the Middle East. We'll see what happens. We'll. See what happens. Very positive impact. Be great. Go ahead. The question will be free. Number one is if you are considering the security guarantees and open to other forms of, for example, intentions, cooperation with your grades and Mister, prime Minister, President Trump has proposed a plan from Gaza. Does this fit into the two state solution that the UK helped for a long time? And there was no prospect. Wanted to go through the. Deal. I don't think they're doing anything they do in a very big impact on that situation, but I don't like talking about Facebook. Desperately needed. To believe that. They did that again with your family, with our fingers. It's a terrible place. Yes. Thank you, Mr President. Did our Prime Minister persuade you not to vote tariffs in the UK? And if the next Prime Minister do you think that it's bad to be beaten is a man who will keep his mind? He tried. Get hard. But he tried to me, I think there's a very good chance that a vacation of these two. Where the terrace. And it's an honor to be with you, and I want to thank everybody. Thank you. Minister of the United Kingdom press conference to fielding questions by Ukraine Terrace in the Middle East today claiming supports Article 5. His word time is Donald Trump. Who we start today with the fact that a story that brings into sharp focus what's at stake with Donald Trump and Elon Musk wanted destruction of federal agencies responsible for everything for treating our plan states in the skies to preventing outbreaks of deadly diseases to get hurt and tackles us from us. Here's the hard truth. In West Africa, Ebola is now an epidemic that we have not seen before, that's spiraling out of control. It is getting worse. It's spreading faster and exponential. So this is an epidemic that's not just a threat to regional security, it's a potential threat to global security. So all we have in the year 2014 and we play a crane today because many of the people who are on the front lines that should be on the front lines today. Fighting and preventing the colon outbreak and preventing and for reaching commercials and spreading in America. Reportedly not there anymore. That's just right assurances for me. Make mistakes with fixed up quite quickly. That's original with the USAD. One of the things we've necessarily found very briefly was Ebola. There was no interruption. Prevention efforts have been largely halted since those allies moved last month to the global assistance agency. Now phrases outgoing payments, they said the teams and contractors that would be deployed to fund people are outbreak have been dismantled. Hey Cortana, USA at the official quote for 4 USAID team with 60 people working on disease response. How did they come to about six staffers as of earlier this week? She added that the infrastructure left in place after Elon Musk slash amber and approach to USAID has now quote a chance of what I want and there are emergencies unfolding around the world as we speak. The Democratic Republic of Congo is why some of the nursing people who help to manage the Ebola outbreak in 2014. Elon Musk today alarm the president of Refugees International and former USAID official tweeting this quote this is most. Of the experts, they are bankruptcy. Most of the part of organizations that have withdrawn from the WHL and Muslim the CDC. What's left is a fixing effort to cover their classes. Political politically, your husband is USAID and the federal workforce is spreading. All of the systems that the US government has built up to protect the US homeland against global outbreak risks. Funding is just window dressing, but window dressing is where we start today with Dr Frank Spencer. He's a horrible recognized emergency room doctor and Brown University School and Public Health associate professor. He is also. 2015 after treating Ebola patients and getting the Doctors Without Borders. Also joining us is director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. Dr Michael Mr Booth is back. And also joining us at the Impolicit podcast at MSNBC National Affairs. Doctor Spencer. I think I'm old enough to have a lift through the scares and actually all that to have been shaped and haunted by the movie depictions outbreak of OF. What a spread of people would be like for folks who don't remember you. Just tell us a little bit about the disease. Yeah, so Poland is one of the deadliest diseases and other encounter as a species update. As quick as possible. I. Hey, Cortana relationships. Fundamental. What is the global Ebola picture look like right now? Transportation and finances and setting up entry. Another organization. We pull back from. Authorization staff, which currently exists, burden. When you are trying to give administration as I'm trying to cover them to understand if they know how bad something is. It feels like a tip of the iceberg story. Is a whole lot of other protections for the American people that have been. In our app for displaying an inch 1 using JavaScript and if we want to change the string content here for example to say Hello JavaScript, that's going to change HTML. But this is entirely static. So to make this dynamic create a variable called language could take this value with that string value. To do that easily we can use that things called template letters and then insert our value. Using this dollar sign and curly brace syntax and then just put in whatever dynamic value we want, in this case it's language. So now if we were to say Python, this one update the UI. In this challenge you need to display at the test content that we just had below Python. Using this function. In moving from Javascript, we learned that. Reusable elements to our applications for something in the last example and right now we have just a button that says like video using only. So before we can create a function with the name create button where we might return the text using. Call create button here, but keep in mind that. Stream and add them to their turn value or function like this. There are still strength here. We're still creating our button. We can go a step further and remove those tags. This template string tags entirely function. Is that can pass them dynamic values? And I'll put that text between tags. So now we've made this part of our UI. For this challenge I'd like you to make impossible to change this first word within our button to make it possible to perform different actions. A big mental shift that needs to take place when you're going for just Java. Dislike video button? No what's the logic behind this video? We need to think about whatever that means. I wanna display a button with the text like video and I wanna make it a green background with a red button dislike video button. Because those are the two types of values that were changing, text and color, or rather the style. We made arguments about both of those so you can pass whatever value we like into the create button function to make that button. It cuts down on our code a lot, and it allows us to focus on more important things. If we want a button, we just say what text and what colors do I want to have that are going on. For this video example, let's make a video player. A big mental shift that needs to take place. We are going from just Javascript to build. Is that we need to start thinking of these functions being little pieces, reusable pieces of our user interface. To work with components. We need to compose them. We not only need to arrange them in the appropriate order so that they. Within the Narendra application you have a tree of components and for trees lightweight react. We start with beginning to create a root and react and for them we need the other package alongside React which is React don't. React don't allows us to create a room specifically with this create room lesson. But what is this exactly doing? We see here that we are using the document API and we're getting an element by ID called root and if we inspect or react up here. Go into the body, you'll see that we do in fact go to dip with the idea of room and right now it's just outputting or out component which displays in each one of the text. Now where is this coming from? We see we have an HTML document and that is coming from the root of our project here regardless of what framework you're using to create something like a beat, which is what I'm using right now, or you're using something like create the act down, you're going to have this index, .Html file. It might be again the root. That is in the main folder of your project, or it might be a folder called public. Regardless, there's going to be some HTML document if you're working with client side React, and we do in fact see here. So it's happening in creating this root is it's inserting reaction. Hey Cortana create a display component in this component. For example, if we wanted to turn this into. Here or in a separate file in. Ultimately whether it's a direct shot descendant of this App component, all our components are going to be displayed with the help of App. Let's break down the concrete steps that we have for making a React application. To create a React application we need to get access to or bring development. Usually we select that with the document API. Create a room by passing the reference to the crank ring method and then we use the render method after so paying close attention to everything that we're doing in this model because your challenge is to within this. JS orindex.Js to create the root of the React application using React to Dome. So take a close look at this and when you're ready go through all the steps of importing reacts, importing React on, getting a reference to the, creating a ring and rendering a component. Value of React components is their reusability. Usable set of elements that we can put wherever we like in as many times as we like is the fact that if we're able to figure out what it needs, it can just put it in a component and pass it around our app wherever it needs to be displayed or used. We're going to start doing that immediately. Right now we're looking at this log in Page. As a React developer, we have to start thinking in terms of components, the pieces of our account, the transition that you have to make from working with HTML to. JSX and components is the fact that we need to be looking actively for parts to break up. So this is what we're going to start doing right away and this is a skill that you need to practice to be good at within this. So we really just extended the exam that we had previously. Of our application, working to start thinking in terms of components and figure out how to break into soft components. We wanted to break it up into components which are going to be in their own files that are going to be a file for. You can see a header up here with. Image and some text. So this is all gonna be the header component. With our email and password inputs, submit button as well as this text. So your job is to take this component and within a display separate header and form component and each of those components are gonna need to find the appropriate JSX the appropriate elements to put in those components in all of these components that are going to live in our own file. The same name and source. So we're gonna have a file called header and one called form. Launch up Youtube. Hey, Cortana. Colorado. Thank you for being here. Hey, good to see you here each of you. Good to see you OK. Hey, Cortana. Successful people in the world in the West 35 years and. That might be. This not a little bit over the course of the next few months, well, all of us are going to hear about is a trouble that I believe could be utilized to grow. Automatic real estate agent broker. I think it's an automatic if you're selling cars for a living. I think it's not practice. I think it's not. The stuff can't play me where many people. It was specifically because I received from you the touch points of your company. But from whatever that's service is trying to stay. Mario and then just write a line. Go for probably 20 years or 67 years old. Is the last one was 20 years on way to guess the party has been working on medical practice and he's been providing. It was not ready to interest you in a different business because I know that's about the information that comes from your company. Would make your company just not something. I think I'm a virtual certainty of that. Hey, Cortana. What is this? When I receive them, it is not gonna come in. That's the truth. That's not like. Tomorrow, potential customer. That's what I think for next minute, for next time. I think it's a suspect and for those of you. There is an income opportunity associated with. 2. Percent of you. Hey, Cortana Spectrum, I believe there's something here for you. Brains United, actually, I've been having his wife. Microphone project about a remarkable person. He successfully lost a company called Dog Fusion back in 2007. Incredible impression on a lot of people. My. Traffic. In many respects. And that that implies to me that it fell out of work that's made me realize that I'm sure that economy so. I will come up in the last time I go from there. I'm going to reimburse you. Reintroducing his magic. Hey, Cortana, how many dollars last year we? Did for 8 one of the great stories. And many of you know business changed with the rules. Change. People put on masculine together in person, the ability to connect with clients, with customers, making it much more difficult. People who historically and unwilling and uneasily. Hey, Cortana's most difficult environment that I've experienced in my 33 years, but for a living, this is the most difficult environment. 6 years ago. Dollars per day, $2 per day and the folks at least three quarter of a million dollars. And six years ago, another example, not one and the best business world that can talk about that kind of result in this particular. Tell you that Bob is not what he ever what's gonna be a lot like that was like. I don't know anyone else. Now you find the part that is meant for you. It might be only, it might be customer acquisition. One of the customer basements, I want to get my opportunity, whatever it is for you. Tampa FL. 35 straight years. I like those people just looking to make extra money for myself. 1st Divine Academy causes all the time. Hey, Cortana. Play third one was on the way to the way. The last one was on the white table, so in 2007. Communication products are most popular products. Video, email. Zipper on the world's last. 6 years ago I started here a fastest. In the industry. In the industry, because companies that run old playbooks are gonna get old results. The company is on the new generation. And innovation, they get ahead of the trend instead of just following the trend. So hand in nutrition. I have now is 13 countries that people they wanna work with me, they wanna get paid very quickly, they they trust me. But by the time I get to that particular value I mean get to that, I mean registering the product. Hey, Cortana. Hey, Cortana. Text to get it done is the problem. So I started thinking right at the beginning of January the first week. Emailed into calorie shows video different messages. So I had a decision I wanted to rebound top feature. Rebirth of a very successful company. Random product, brand new website. In one minute, which is super exciting. New autoresponder. People around the world are extremely excited a product. And it plays like a movie instead of a boring. Boxes like mine, the last 100 emails that you got or so. People, you have no relationship. Hey Cortana, delete with this product out. Personality. In your inbox and definitely stay out of the future. So the way that unfortunately very simple one 27 you choose a template. Choose from in many different languages on personal phone number you thank you. I'm sorry to be in trouble. We have all templates for pets. German Shepherd Dawson, you know so. This business card, it's also because thanks for being our customer in my sharing customer. Why don't you get a more customer? How can we do that as your customer? Product announcements download customer. Thing you want, it's likely there thousands. Influencers to use it. More. That will take a look at your. Template so that when you send it out in the inbox. On social media, read and text that anybody wants so you know they can go far in the bigger tablet. Step 2 upload order. Free and said he's in the one person or up to 10,000 at a time. The product is super smart and let you know who watch your video, email, when and actually for how long and then how long they want. So time is money, so he said. That there really is this product. I'll let you know instantly when they are watching. Set a meeting. 5630. Person download. Cruise lines, DHLS and their Applebee's Restaurant police departments. I mean real estate is car sales people, dentist doctors, I mean dance studios. I mean it's really interesting the cross section of them, which is really. It says it's a tremendous spot to use video. Email Zanzi people checking. Move. On. Silence. The perfect conversion of everything of time. OK. So the. Emails. OK Roger. Yeah. Where they. Yeah. Sonogram. Oh, got kidney stones. Hey, Cortana. Stop. And I said. You talk. To him, he said. Why don't you tell me what he's doing? Because I didn't explain anyway. Not to explain to have a test OK perfect. So he's my friend. A Domino's I can't do it tonight because I promise I can't. OK. OK. Every person OK. Yeah, you sure will. Surely will. Hey, Cortana. Yeah, we'll see. The thing about it is, I'm just gonna point him on today. I'll definitely. Talk to him, but I'm gonna point him to the outdoor later on tonight. What time is gonna be? Trying to point up to. Well, not for tomorrow. Got down for 12 too. But no, we don't have to get. We might let me look at the he might have, but I haven't gotten it yet. Yeah. Yeah, we'll email it out. This in the Whatsapp will be the one that's. Yeah, well, we're the the time will be on Whatsapp. For tomorrow, no, we we won't know 3040 minutes. You know they haven't posted it yet. So I'm feeling. Yeah. No. Yeah. Right now. Wow. Yeah. Yeah, I've never met her. I've never met her husband. He's a novel. Oh wow, for like two to three days. About two years now, if that. I don't want to say my business around, yeah. Yeah. You know when I came with someone? Yeah. Come on, baby. You ask me to come at your house 10, 10:30 in the morning. I get there. You're not ready to do well. My success is talking to me because I love you. Because my city is not an Oscar, yeah. Give people the emails so that we can send out one 10 thousand things if you wouldn't get 10,000 people. Oh man, just imagine if I had said something like that. Yeah. I gotta trust people. Just and. Already. Yeah. Welcome. You're welcome. Yeah. Oh, wow. They're gonna raise some prices on office, yeah. Oh yeah, yeah. Yeah, no. A lot of people. I know. This would be a good time to catch them, 'cause it's got a huge mailing list. This would really help him not only stand out free brand, they can make money in the process. So. Yeah. So. It's like 10% of you. Like to do the military building over 10% of you. And he's just like. People who are already focused there already. Yeah, but you know what they he's not a dictator. You know what? I know he's gonna try to do **** but I don't. I don't think you know. Yeah, well, yeah. And the thing about it is. 510464. Yeah, that's. Gonna have to stop so. Anyway. Stated I mean, I'm, I'm keeping them up with it too. They have made a determination. They just they delighted but you know. Location learn. Whatnot. Two people who have not returned an application. Yeah, no idea. It really is. It really is. Yeah. Well, that's what his attorney argued. That's what one of the judges said. Are you saying that you can just do anything you want? And the attorney that was argued from president? Bajrang Shibuya. And. At the same time. Alright, so. He said that no God. And they had to test them, and that's how they are now. He, he definitely would have benefited from government benefiting something down, you know? Yeah. Yeah. Well, thank you, Randy. So I gotta. Yeah. There's a lot of there is a lot of motivations for somebody to be successful, that's for sure. There's a lot of motivation for people for you to be successful. Yeah. Yeah, I love it. I've gone to conference call. What you should do is we we, you know, for you to learn more about it. You should be getting on the on the zoom file just to listen. Yeah. You started at 6. At this point. Going forward in the future though, you know what you want to look at the schedule and. One or two, you know you can listen to it because the more you see it here, but you understand what it is. So on the metric goes back to here tomorrow, alright? Yeah. Yeah, if I was a good, I would, yeah. No, I've listened to it over almost 30 times, 40 times. Alright, here you go. Alright, well, let me let you go. We'll talk tomorrow. I'll be around, look for your partner. Alright, talk to you later. You're welcome. Bye, bye. Have you considered this? Microsoft is probably something else. We talk about. Hey Cortana, get the best results number 4. Hey, Cortana. Appreciate that. Services. Hey, Cortana. Good. Your call has been forward. Hello. Yeah, OK. Yeah, I understand. But yeah, talk to Kevin. Yeah. Hi. How are you? Good. How are you? I'm good, thank you. Excited. I know I met you a long time ago, but yeah, we did. Yeah, yeah. OK. 10 years ago, I think I was longer than that, yeah. Actually, girl, my gosh. Translate. It's almost 20 years ago. Sorry. Yeah. I'm sorry. It is crazy. It was real crazy. But that's when Paul and I got in. Yeah. So I'm interested that I think this is like definitely, definitely, yeah, definitely. I mean, the thing is kind of excited about it is the fact that, you know. It's a paradigm shift as far as technology. You know, everybody's gonna wanna use it for their businesses. Yeah, it pays in one minute and there's no inventory. And this, this is this is not hard. And where. Inventory cabinet. That was a big thing. Yeah, I know. The other ship on this is $20 or $40 and $50. Yeah, that's good. Yeah. And the thing about it is also makes it great. You know anybody international, worldwide, you can have people. You're from South Africa. You can have people in South Africa on this thing from day one getting paid. So it's a tremendous opportunity. And all these players, you know, all these black diamonds and blue diamonds from Montevideo jumped in left to right. It's it's a lot of players that that scares me. You know that. You know why that scares me? What? They're going to get everybody. No. People now can't wait. You got if you got it. Just real quick. Did you give you the information so I can get in? Yeah. Like I got it. Yeah. OK. Hold on for a second, I thought you said. I thought you sent me an hour. Can you send me an app? Oh, OK. Alright, over here, let me fill one out for you. Alrighty. But I want to have anyway so I can know how to send it to other people. **** are you on? Are you on Whatsapp? Yes, I sent you one in Whatsapp. Hold on, I'm going to. Right now you are. Where is Miriam? Where is that the 818-9290? I'm standing banning CA near Palm Springs, Morongo. Are you are you 81829 O 68 O6. OK. Nice. If you go into your Whatsapp, I sent you the conversation plan and the application. No, yeah. I sent this one directly to you at 8182906806806. Did you go? You can just use one day with all the info. But you know, see, Gavin, give me your take my telephone number and add me into your contacts. Your name is here and everything. So I can see. I should see the application. Yeah, I mean, I did this yesterday and I'm looking at it right now. It shows. Let me see what I'm gonna say something. Do you see me now? Hold on. Wait, is it this one? zenfront.net now that's not.

We just have them send a copy that up to us. What I'm going to do is I'm gonna put your information in. Gavin's information in and then I'm gonna fax it over to Randy. But I'll be putting people in for our particular leg. So you. I don't know that Gavin sponsored you and anybody you sponsor, you know you'll send me that and let me know. And, you know we'll send it over to Randy. But yeah, when they start putting it together for real, when they start structuring the leg, he'll be on the phone with me as far as. You know, I have to listen to everybody who needs to replace. OK so, so we yeah. And I will definitely be in the car. Like all these people that Gavin and I get. Yeah. Yeah. What, like they'll they'll be? Oh well, think about it is it really doesn't matter. But the thing about it is you're going to want to build pretty much you, you and Gavin are being a power leg, and then you work your own leg, but you won't have to go. Instead of building 2, you only have to build one, right? So the big people we get in, we should put it on the other side. You only need to put one or two. You need to put one in the power leg between the power. Yeah, I understand. The application is there, is there a place of, yeah, OK.

Yes, with the S ready OK. .com Gavin Brown Is Your Enroller. And so you. Choose one of the three packets that you want to come in on. You can don't matter where you start. A lot of people find the 175, but as soon as you get a few people you'll probably, you know a lot of people move up to the Pro afterwards. The difference in the packs is the entry pack, starter pack, starter pack. You get one custom template. The So like with your tennis, you could have your own custom, you know, branding for the tenants because the elite pack you get 3. OK. Well, start out, start out with here. Get a few people in. Yeah, you can change leg 'cause I started out with the 175 and now I'm doing the 700. Yeah. Alright, once I got the few people in it though, I went to 700. So now I'm doing the 700, yeah. I think it might change to that OK. So, Marianne, is it OK? If I, I'm gonna sign for you and I'll just put my initials. Yeah. Thank you. No, but you wanna send it, send it to your people and. Yeah. OK, yeah. And what I'll do is, Mariana, I'll send you the the compensation analysis that I just put together. I'll show you everything now that I know who you are. I'm send you everything I got. And the other thing today, what is today's date 220? Today is the 27th. OK. 27 2025 You do you have my number? Oh yeah, now I did 323. Yeah. If you you have, feel free to use it for three ways or if you need Paul, I'll get you this number as well. We're all available to you each question. We're excited about it. We were the first pause in Lagoon together. Yeah, he he actually sponsored me in this. Randy told him. For me, me and him were in the first 7 people to hear about it. That's a beautiful area. Launch March launch. You'll have full access to everything he's doing, websites and everything. But this is where it's gonna be until launch and then the day of lunch, you know you wanna turn applications that will be paid within one minute, and then you'll have access to the emails and all that. It'd be just as easy as sending out the email then. But right now you can sign up for free and placement in April sometime, but they just start a date. Yeah, he hasn't given us a date yet. So we got between 5 and six weeks, maybe seven weeks to really get it hard. More people you can put in better. That's right. Now you know what they don't need. We don't need to take a credit card that people can tell people and you know, like we're doing with stacking folks. Yeah. And it's great for stacking and it's all wonderful. And it's not like a roundabout as people, but OK. Oh yeah, for those who understand, they won't wait because they want to get in now. So you get the position a lot, you know what I'm saying? Like people as far as well, then we have to make them understand that, you know what, do you want to come, do you want to wait April with 500 people got in before you or do you want to get it now, so those 500 people. Well, not only now workers, but you know anybody is you don't have to be a networker to understand that you know you want to be early as opposed to late. Do you want to be in the line? Do you want to be one number 1000 or do you want to be number 100? What I would recommend it tomorrow, there's two zoom calls, one at 6:00 PM your time and one at 9:00 PM and. Yeah, and listen yourself. The more you hear it, clearer OK. Congratulations. So intellectual. He really is, he really is. So the way he goes. So you can understand if Bob, Randy, Paul, me, Gavin, the youth, so you're within 6 from the top. That's cool. In San Diego, Randy's living in Salt Lake City. Not Salt Lake City, but Utah. She's somewhere in Utah. Yeah, I think he just sold his house and said yeah. Wow. I was surprised. Yeah. You know, Randy, yeah, I actually did. I actually got up to some things that we did 0. Yeah, yeah. He's really nice. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I missed better within the last year. He's been. No, you know what Lamonte see the difference is Paul and I were cross line Darrell letterback who was my sponsor and and. And Paul sponsor come to find out Darrell was one who was one of the founders of Malabi. I was in another company with a lot, lot of people and they're always coming about until like three years after the fact 34 years. It was already up and running when we heard about it. Where? As Paul was in the first 500, you said 490 people quit. He was one of the ten that remained, and he's made like about $18 million for the last twenty years in Monte Beach, and that's. And yeah, yeah, I remember dropping Daryl off from out of the meetings and had no idea what was going on. Wow. Yeah. So you know what it it it hurts for a while. But you know what? He's dead now. You live in and you learn and looking. And now look at this. I never imagined in a position like this. Fresh, binary, established company, great compensation plan. Digital. This is easy. You know this is everybody understands the email. I do too. Much. Bella rest of the clubhouse. Yeah, it's a job. I remember. Hey, Cortana, advertisement Internet. How long ago was this? OK. Yeah, no III. Just do them. Until last year, we weren't actually wearing another company right now called me Low Life and it's just sort of, it's a great concept. Yeah, Neelo, Neal. We get to hotel discounts. Costco Sam's Club with the subscription but it's not working. Force majeure. Are you. We know somebody's gonna patches. Yeah, we're gonna. Yeah, well you know what, you could do it so you can, you can send some emails on on the patch. You can do this, yeah, yeah, this this helps with whatever network you're doing, you know? Yeah, but are you there? Yeah. Yeah. And you should fall asleep. No, I just. Already. Well, you got. You know what? I'll send you my email address to Marianne so you can send me stuff if you need to, or you can always send me stuff through Whatsapp as well. Alrighty, you too. You too. Look forward to working with you. Yep, you're signed up. Welcome to the team. All right, all right, OK. Bye. Bye. Alright, talk to you later. For this solution I'm assuming. 3 ways somebody intimidated. Yeah, good work with 20 years ago. She's a very angle, Andrew, and what she said, give me your your email, which is Mary Ann's tennis. I immediately remember who she was. How weird. Yeah, 'cause I did some meetings all over the lot of meetings in the Valley for people and. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, it's crazy. No, not at all. I gotta call it. Yeah million. Yeah, I heard you were good shorts. Short and sweet. And Mary Ann was on that call we go, so I. Didn't even hear it. So yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I got a text back from us but saying asking when Ronnie was gonna be there too. And he said you let me know tomorrow. So I said she's gonna be there between Sunday and Tuesday. You know, and I texted her to let her know and also. Sam called me years old. Ronnie told me that he's got a friend that owns a store and Oak Bluffs and, you know. He knows everybody. Yeah, yeah. So Ronnie Bush, Ronnie started work through, she said have him get him on the phone with you. Be a good one for this. I said. OK tell me what to say so. You know, I'm I. 'M talking to her. I forgot about Malcolm. I don't know why we have. He's got serious Africa. Next next time I talk to her, I will ask her. I saw that. Well, you know, he's going to make the world. He's going to be making noise. Everybody's work either. Yeah, before I battle too much for the last one, you know, he's a battles everyone. He's he's got great content, but it's almost like landing. This is not trained, no. People how to do the business. Like, yeah, this is presentation. Yeah, presentation. You want to get into it that quick, but you know what, people are getting it and people are starting that up. So what you gonna say? You know. What are you going to say or do? So that's good. Anyway, I got to talk about yesterday, something about Facebook at Down Inside People Up. That's crazy. There you go. You never know. Well, yeah, I totally understand. You don't get paid if I say. No monarchy was the 4th or 5th bottle of juice. There's three or four forms. We made the most money. There's no need or scope either. A sango. Those all came out before modern God first market. You just have to do the best. Yeah, this is going through something. Ask Bob that question. Well, yeah, that's what. Yeah, I said the same thing I said. You know what? Just a good day after the first thing is in heaven is it means we can pay, you know? You know and they probably have a living on how many you said so anywhere. I just want to let you know that yeah, just you, you three later in from Florida. Mary Ann Calandra and she says, you know, get some people on it, so. No, she's from Sherman Oaks. Florida, you know, she's back there. She's her mom. She lives in Sherman House. OK. Great. Right. Hey Cortana, this is something that we did to practice. By commenting that. 's here, so we're going to copy this and replace it, even though we have kind of just like USA. Successfully the same thing. Everything. So let's go ahead and copy the JSX returning any JSS. Be aware that even though there's a space here. That's not gonna translate in additional space these components, their content is still gonna be right next to. Just be aware of that, you know, something like a separate or something. Around the floor. Successfully. Because now we break them into separate files at their own name, and we're going to do that within the source. Now that your code is going to be hand source, or you might be dedicated. We're just going to have just going to have a directly in source right now and we're going to go ahead and create each of those files again. We're going to need to have an extension. Dot JSX is how he does it, which is the framework I'm using. So I'm gonna take. And. Again, remind me to talk. To talk. Hey Cortana stop login page download this phone number. 20 times. In this app we're displaying one discussion this discussion. Is. Discussion. So this is. Discussion and the discussion as well as. The fact that they need to be pure purity is a very social concept. But it's useful where it comes to thinking about components because. As a function, it's going to have an input. Side effects was a side effect. Here means something other than. The side of the component that would make it. A great example of a good example, a good example of a different one to display account in each discussion. Discussion One Discussion 2 7 So. We could within discussion. Strange. Discussion, too. And discussion for now. That's what we can get a place to work that's happening. So let's do that. And you expect something to components that we would only get too long. And the reason for this is. Is to figure out what to do to make sure. Specifically, discussion is purely returned JS and it does not change the objects variables that exist in before rendering. And ultimately when you fix this and make it cure, you shouldn't be able to see the incorrect incorrect discussion and discussion between. And this app we're displaying one. Discussion and sit here and this is. As a function, it's going to happen. But what that means is that needs to make sure that. Let's see what happens. So make sure. To pick up. The fix the result which is solving the challenge. Hey Cortana, simplest way to fix this is to just take this job and put it inside discussion. But this doesn't work for any discussion or any discussion too. Why this is if we take what's happening? Every time is rendered. Discussion is not predictable. To fix this the manual way to entirely. Pass it down. I.
